# Analyzing-Three-Decades-of-Global-Health-Clustering-PCA-and-the-Evolution-of-Mortality-Rates
This study employs a multifaceted analytical approach that includes various methodologies to analyze global health. It combines cluster analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the percentage change in the health index from 1990 to 2019, encompassing various causes of death. In this case, the research question focuses on understanding health trends over the past three decades, with the primary goal of creating health policies that promote targeted resource allocation, improve disease prevention, and advance equity in global health.

This study also highlights the contribution made by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, emphasizing its relevance while acknowledging its limitations. Several hypotheses are developed, examining the prevalence of specific diseases, the clustering of countries with similar health profiles, and changes in health over the years. Both K-Means clustering and PCA methods are utilized to examine the primary drivers of mortality change. This analysis enables the creation of effective health policies, targeted resource allocation, and the direction of future research efforts. The ultimate aim of this study is to foster a better understanding of the factors contributing to global health through their interaction.
